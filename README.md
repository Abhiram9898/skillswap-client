@reduxjs/toolkit

react-redux

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation
Follow these steps to get the SkillSwap frontend running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn

Clone the Repository
git clone <your-frontend-repo-url>
cd client # Navigate into the frontend directory

Install Dependencies
npm install
# OR
yarn install

Environment Variables
Create a .env.local file in the client (frontend) directory. This file will store your backend API URL.

VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000 
# Replace with your backend's URL. If deployed, use the production URL (e.g., https://your-backend.onrender.com)

Run the Development Server
npm run dev
# OR
yarn dev

The application should now be running at http://localhost:5173 (or another port if 5173 is in use).

üì¶ Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm run dev: Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:5173 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

npm run build: Builds the app for production to the dist folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

npm run lint: Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues.

npm run preview: Serves the dist folder locally for a production preview.

üìÇ Project Structure (Key Directories)
src/: Contains all the source code for the React application.

assets/: Static assets like images.

components/: Reusable UI components (e.g., Header, SkillCard, ChatComponent, PrivateRoute, AdminRoute).

pages/: Top-level components representing different views/pages of the application (e.g., HomePage, LoginForm, AdminDashboard).

redux/: Redux store setup and individual slices (authSlice, skillSlice, chatSlice, etc.).

utils/: Utility functions and Axios instance configuration.

App.jsx: Main application component responsible for routing.

main.jsx: Entry point for the React application.

‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment
This frontend is designed to be deployed as a static site.

Vercel / Netlify: Highly recommended for their ease of use, automatic CI/CD, and global CDN.

Connect your Git repository.

Set the build command to npm run build and the output directory to dist.

Configure VITE_API_URL as an environment variable in the deployment platform's settings, pointing to your deployed backend URL.
